### Project description
Guess the number guessed by computer in minimum tries

:arrow_up:[To contents](https://github.com/FedorPinchuk/sf_data_science/blob/main/project_0/README.md#Contents)

### What case is being solved
Write a programm that guesses a number in minimum tries

**Case conditions**
* Computer guesses an integer number from 0 to 100 and we need to guess it correctly. 'Guess' meaning we need to write a programm that 'guesses' the number
* Algorythm gives un 'hints' on whether the guessed number is bigger or smaller in regards to the number guessed by the computer

**Quality metrics**

Result are evaluated by mean number of tries on 1000 instances

**What do we practice**

We hone our python programming skills
