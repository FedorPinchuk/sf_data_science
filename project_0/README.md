### Project description
Guess the number guessed by computer in minimum tries (20 or less)

### What case is being solved
Write a programm that guesses a number in minimum tries (20 or less)

**Case conditions**
* Computer guesses an integer number from 0 to 100 and we need to guess it correctly. 'Guess' meaning we need to write a programm that 'guesses' the number
* Algorythm takes into account if the guessed number is lesser or bigger that it predicts and adjusts it accordingly

**Quality metrics**

Result are evaluated by mean number of tries on 1000 instances. We need to make it guess in the least amounth of tries

**What do we practice**

We hone our python programming skills, learn to work in IDE and Github
